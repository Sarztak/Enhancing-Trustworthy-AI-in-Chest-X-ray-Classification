# Enhancing Trustworthy AI in Chest X-ray Classification
 Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Accurate and timely diagnosis through chest X-rays is critical for patient care. However, current AI systems often provide a hard prediction without indicating how confident they are.In high-stakes scenarios like medical diagnostics, understanding the uncertainty behind a prediction can be as important as the prediction itself. This project aims to incorporate Bayesian methods (via MC Dropout) into a deep learning model so that we can quantify both spatial and predictive uncertainty. This helps clinicians understand whether a high-confidence prediction should be trusted or re-examined.
